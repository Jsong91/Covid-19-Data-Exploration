# Covid-19-Data-Exploration

#### For almost 2 years, we have been living with the Covid-19 Pandemic since it surfaced in November 2019. By exploring and analysing the dataset, I hope to understand current trend based on data

I have extract the Covid-19 Dataset from **<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths" rel="nofollow">OurWorldinData</a>** from **24 Feb 2020 to 22 June 2021**.

**Analysis Process**

- Initial analysis of datasets used Microsoft Excel.
- Data cleaning, manipulation and exploration using Microsoft SQL.
- Data Visualization using Tableau Public via Dashboard.

**From the dataset, 4 key areas interests me for me to perform further analysis:**

- % Population Infected Per Country
- Global Covid Numbers
- Total Death Per Continents
- % Population Infected of 5 countries that I am interested in.
